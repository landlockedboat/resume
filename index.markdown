**Software development passionate CS graduate eager to learn more about software craftsmanship.** I like to build things, and I consider myself a very creative and restless person. I love good design and ellegance in all the products I develop. I’ve participated in numerous Hackathons and I’ve been to a great deal of Game Jams, and did numerous side projects on my own as well. I love working with proactive and creative people and also sharing cool ideas with them. My biggest flaw is that i need to feel part of what I’m building to pour my 100% into a project.
