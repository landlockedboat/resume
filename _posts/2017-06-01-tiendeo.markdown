I did a summer internship at Tiendeo, worked with some great people and learned a lot through the process.

During my stay there i worked in several projects:

* Expand the existing functionalities of Tiendeo's API using C# and Postman
* Added new functions to Tiendeo's Analytics service built in .NET
* Created the basis for a new PDF-parsing and uploading service refactored from legacy code using .NET
* Developed a Visual Studio extension using C# that enables developers to work faster by providing useful code snippets for the design patterns in use at the time
* Participated in the Tiendeo JajaThon, a design challenge to build the best product and create a marketing campaing for it during a workday the finished campaign can be found [here](https://twitter.com/i/moments/880806537173839872)
