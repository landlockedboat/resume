Teacher at a 2-week (60 hours) winter break course about advanced game development with Unity.

I taught the following concepts about game development to my students during the course:

* Game Design
* Game Development Team and Project Management
* Collaborative work in Unity (Git and Unity Collab)
* AMVCC (Application Model View Component Controller) code pattern for Unity
* Shaders
* External tool integration (SketchUp, Blender)
* Unity Multiplatform development
* Mobile Market (IAP, UnityAds)
* Basic FPS development
* Editor Tools
* ScriptableObjects
* Serialization / IO

Attached to this post there can be found screenshots of the final projects of the students
